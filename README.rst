===========

Inhouse-Web is web-based time recording and tracking software built for
companies, that want to track their projects worktime to get an accurate time
billing for their customers. In contrast to other time trackers, Inhouse-Web
will not offer an own task system. It directly synchronizes with other issue
tracking systems like Trac so that each employee can connect their worktime with
already existing tickets for their projects. But, This application is quite more
than a simple time tracking system. You can also manage you companies stock of
soft- and hardware, books and other material used in an IT service company.

The application is written entirely in Python and uses the Django webframework.
